# Association-and-Clustering-Analysis
This data set contains a set of recipes from the website epicurious.com and their ingredients, including user-generated tags of the general geographical area that the cuisine is from. Each row represents one recipe and contains the cuisine as well as a list of the ingredients used.
The goal of this analysis is to identify clusters and ingredient groups in the data rather than to predict a given outcome variable.Â
